    2) Convert a float to an int
    3) Perform floor division using a float and an int.
    4) Use two user inputted values to perform multiplication.

    Take note of what information is lost when some conversions take place.

'''


A = 1
A = float(A)
print(A)

B = 10.0
B = int(B)
print(B)

print(10//5.0)

num_1 = int(input("input a number"))
num_2 = int(input("input another number"))
print(num_1 * num_2)
